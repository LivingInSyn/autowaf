# autowaf

A service which updates the WAF IP blocklist

# Development

Project is currently in development phase.

## Build
### Build and run locally

```shell
go build -o autowaf && ./autowaf -ldb
```
The `-ldb` argument will change the database port to `54300` and change the `update-rate` to 1 minute. It will also prevent the app from trying to get database credentials from cloudfoundry environmental variables.
